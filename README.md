# NHL Draft Simulator

This app was made as a personal project to simulate the NHL Draft Lottery.
As a suffering Hurricanes fan over the past 8 years, I wanted to check on
what their chances are of getting the #1 draft pick.  It was built using
CoffeeScript.

## Getting started

Here are the steps needed to get the app up and running.

1. In terminal, clone the repo

``` git clone https://github.com/BobbyErickson89/NHL_Draft.git ```

2. Move into the NHL Draft directory

``` cd NHL_Draft ```

3. Run an ```npm install``` to download all the project's dependencies.

4. Run ```npm run coffee:watch``` to compile our .coffee files
 into .js files.

5. Run ```npm run node:watch``` to start up our app.  It should now be
running on localhost:3000 in your browser of choice.
